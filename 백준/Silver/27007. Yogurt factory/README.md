### 문제 설명

<p>The cows have purchased a yogurt factory that makes world-famous Yucky Yogurt. Over the next N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000) weeks, the price of milk and labor will fluctuate weekly such that it will cost the company C_i (1 ≤ C_i ≤ 5,000) cents to produce one unit of yogurt in week i. Yucky's factory, being well-designed, can produce arbitrarily many units of yogurt each week.</p>

<p>Yucky Yogurt owns a warehouse that can store unused yogurt at a constant fee of S (1 ≤ S ≤ 100) cents per unit of yogurt per week. Fortuitously, yogurt does not spoil. Yucky Yogurt's warehouse is enormous, so it can hold arbitrarily many units of yogurt.</p>

<p>Yucky wants to find a way to make weekly deliveries of Y_i (0 ≤ Y_i ≤ 10,000) units of yogurt to its clientele (Y_i is the delivery quantity in week i). Help Yucky minimize its costs over the entire N-week period. Yogurt produced in week i, as well as any yogurt already in storage, can be used to meet Yucky's demand for that week.</p>
